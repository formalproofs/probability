# Formalizing Markov Decision Processes in Lean

[![Blueprint](https://img.shields.io/badge/Blueprint-WIP-blue)](https://formalproofs.github.io/MDPLib)

Verified Lean algorithms for solving tabular MDPs and proving their properties. The focus of this project is on two main goals:

1. Basic algorithms that can solve robust and risk-averse MDPs of moderate size. 

2. Proofs of correctness of algorithms and fundamental MDP properties which can be used independently to prove structural results, such as the optimality of certain policy class.
